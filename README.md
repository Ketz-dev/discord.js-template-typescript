## Quick start
1. **Get this template:** Click on the "Use this template" button. This will allow you to create a new repository with this project's structure on your Github account. Then you can clone it to your local machine.

3. **Setup up a bot application:** If you have already made an application for your bot, skip this step. Otherwise, see this [page](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) on how to setup a bot application.

4. **Setup environment variables:** Change the values in the `.env` file to the appropriate values:

- `BOT_TOKEN` - your bot application's token

```

## Typescript

You can configure the Typescript compiler in `tsconfig.json`. To keep the codebase safe, the `strict` flag is set to true. Feel free to disable this flag and add your preferred configurations.

## NPM scripts

A brief description of the scripts you'll find in `package.json`:

- `start` - Starts the development server. Use it to test your bot during development.
- `build` - Generates the production build in the `build/` folder located in the project's root.
